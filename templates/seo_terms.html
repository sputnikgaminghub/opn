  <h2>2. The Site and Features</h2>
  <h3 class="subhead">Description of the Site and Features</h3>
<p>The Platform enables you to participate in prediction markets by placing wagers on the outcomes of future events (“Prediction Markets”). You may create or participate in Prediction Markets by staking cryptocurrency on potential outcomes. All Prediction Markets must be based on objectively verifiable events and outcomes that can be determined through reliable third-party data sources (“Oracle Sources”).</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to determine which Oracle Sources will be used to verify outcomes. The Company will clearly indicate the designated Oracle Source(s) for each Prediction Market at the time of market creation. Once an outcome has been determined based on data from the designated Oracle Source(s), it shall be considered final and binding. The Company maintains sole discretion over which types of events may be the subject of Prediction Markets and may remove or suspend any markets that violate these Terms or Applicable Laws (as defined below). You may not create or participate in markets related to illegal activities, personal violence, terrorism, or other prohibited subjects as determined by the Company.</p>
<p>The pricing information provided on the Site relating to Prediction Markets does not represent an offer, a solicitation of an offer, or any advice regarding, or recommendation to enter, a transaction with the Company.</p>
<p>Even when the Site appears to be dynamic (e.g., updating or providing new displays when you – on your own accord – provide certain information), at no time is the Company acting directed by you or on your behalf. In addition, if you connect wallet on the Site such that your self-hosted cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”) is able to provide information to be transmitted to a blockchain network or other blockchain-based application, you should note that the Company (i) is not involved in providing or transmitting any such information to networks, (ii) cannot transmit any information to networks or otherwise assist in any transaction, (iii) never has access to and cannot control or provide guarantees relating to your Wallet and (iv) has no authority over and does not take possession or custody of your cryptoassets at any time, except as otherwise discussed herein.  This also means that the Company is unable to assist with transactions: please be vigilant in interacting with any immutable blockchain technology.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for familiarizing yourself with your Wallet and its safety and security features, including any private keys and passwords associated therewith.  We will not and cannot access your private key, password, or any cryptoassets held within your Wallet nor can it reverse any transactions you initiate with your Wallet (or otherwise). We cannot be responsible or liable in any way for how you use your Wallet.</p>
<p>You should also familiarize yourself with the risks associated with transacting on blockchain networks, including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, front end vulnerabilities, hacks, phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, cryptoasset volatility and transaction irreversibility.</p>
<p>The Company is not responsible for the operation of any blockchain network, and the Company does not make any guarantee of the network’s functionality, security, or availability.  The Company is not responsible for the activities of persons or entities who develop or use applications or who validate or verify transactions or other operations related to blockchain networks operated by third parties.  The Company cannot control how blockchain networks operated by third parties market their blockchain networks and users should not assume any blockchain networks operated by third parties are affiliated with the Company. All transactions broadcast to the applicable blockchain network via your Wallet may require the payment of non-refundable network transaction fees, which shall be borne entirely by you.</p>
<p>We do not effectuate, facilitate or control any transactions initiated via the Platform, and the Company will not be responsible for the result of any transactions, including but not limited to failed, inadvertent, or fraudulent transactions that may result in loss of funds or transaction fees or any other loss or harm to you.</p>
<p>Your Acknowledgement Relating to the Site and Information on the Site You hereby acknowledge and agree that all information provided as part of the Content Features in connection with your access and use of the Site is intended for informational purposes only.

<p>You should take all steps to independently verify any information on the Site and any Interface on which you intend to rely and should not take action based solely on any information contained on any Interfaces, including blog posts, data, articles, links to third-party content, social media content, news feeds, tutorials and videos.</p>
<p>None of the information provided on the Site, any other Interface, or through the Features should be construed as professional or investment advice, and the Company does not owe any duties and does not have any obligations to you based on the information provided on the Site, any other Interface, or through the Features.  You acknowledge and agree that all information provided in connection with your access and use of the Site, any other Interface, and the Features is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice.  You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained on the Site or any other Interface, or any other information that we make available at any time, including, without limitation, blog posts, articles, links to third-party content, discord content, news feeds, tutorials, social media content, and videos. Before you make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Features, you should seek independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate. The Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms.</p>
<p>None of the information provided on the Site, any other Interface, or through any of the Features shall be interpreted as an invitation or inducement to (i) exercise any rights to acquire, dispose of, underwrite, or convert any cryptoassets or digital assets or (ii) buy, sell, or induce a user to buy or sell any cryptoassets or digital assets.</p>
<p>The Company is not acting as an investment adviser, trading, tax, legal or other adviser to any person or entity.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the Terms at any time or from time to time.  The modified Terms will be posted on the Site and any other Interface and will provide the last updated date at the top.  Any modified Terms will become effective upon posting.  By continuing to access, use or otherwise interact with any Interface or Feature after the effective date of any modification to the Terms, you are providing your explicit agreement to be bound by the Terms as modified.  If you do not agree to be bound by any updated Terms, you are prohibited from using, accessing, or otherwise interacting with the Interfaces or Features.  It is your responsibility to check any Interface you use regularly for modifications to the Terms.</p>
<p>To the Site, any other Interface, or the Features We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, substitute, eliminate, restrict access to, or add to the Site, any other Interface, or any Feature at any time and from time to time, with or without notice to you, including deleting or otherwise materially modifying content and information.</p>
<p>We may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable (temporarily or permanently) the Site, any other Interface, or the Features, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, to only allow open contracts to be closed. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Site, any other Interface, or the Features will immediately cease. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Site, any other Interface, or Features or from any modification, suspension, or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Site, any other Interface, or the Features. The Site, any other Interface, and the Features may evolve, which means the Company may apply changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Site, any other Interface, or the Features at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The following sections of these Terms will survive any termination of your access to the Site, any other Interface, or the Features, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive: Sections 5, 7-10.</p>

<p>As a condition to accessing or using the Site or the Features, you represent and warrant to the Company the following:</p>
<p>Of Age and Legal Authority. The Site, any other Interface, and Features are intended only for users who are 18 years of age or older. If you are entering into the Terms on behalf of an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind such an entity. If you do not meet these requirements, you are prohibited from accessing, using or otherwise interacting with the Site, any other Interface, or Features.</p>
<p>Sanctions. You represent and warrant that you are not, and for the duration of the time you use the Site, any other Interface, and Features, will not be (i) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties; (ii) in contravention of any laws and regulations pertaining to anti-money laundering or terrorist financing; (iii) included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or on any list pursuant to European Union (EU) and/or United Kingdom (UK) regulations (as the latter are extended to Panama by statutory instrument); or (iv) operationally based or domiciled in a country or territory in which sanctions imposed by the United Nations (whether through the Security Council or otherwise), OFAC, the EU and/or the UK apply, or otherwise pursuant to sanctions imposed by the United Nations, OFAC, EU, or UK.  If at any point the above is no longer true, then you must immediately cease using the Site, any other Interface, and Features.</p>
<p>Restricted Jurisdictions.  You acknowledge and agree that you are not permitted to access, use or trade with the Prediction Markets on the Platform if you are residing in, a citizen of, organized in or located in the following jurisdictions (collectively, the “Restricted Jurisdictions”): a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States, including but not limited to Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea, and the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, the United States, United Kingdom, France, Ontario, Singapore, Poland, Thailand, South Korea, People’s Republic of China, Taiwan Province or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wallet Configuration.  You represent and warrant that you – and only you – are responsible for properly configuring, as applicable, and using the Site, any other Interface, or the Features or incorporating the Features into your applications or Wallet and for taking appropriate action to secure your data, including without limitation, financial or token information and private keys.</p>
<p>No VPN To Circumvent or Attempt to Circumvent.  You do not, and will not, use VPN software or any other privacy or anonymization tools or techniques to circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, any restrictions that apply to the Site, any other Interface, or the Features.</p>
<p>Sophistication.  You represent and warrant that you possess sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, experience and skills to engage with the Site, any other Interface, and the Features, including the Platform if you are permitted to use it, and that you have the requisite understanding of blockchain technology, cryptoassets and cryptography to be able to engage with the Features.</p>
<p>Applicable Law.  Your access to the Site, any other Interface, and Features is not (i) prohibited by and does not otherwise violate or assist you to violate any domestic or foreign law, rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order, protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement, or guideline, published or in force that applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, property, transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or other requirement or guideline issued by any domestic or foreign federal, provincial or state, municipal, local or other governmental, regulatory, judicial or administrative authority having jurisdiction over the Company, you, the Site, any other Interface, or the Features, or as otherwise duly enacted, enforceable by law, the common law or equity (collectively, “Applicable Laws”); or (ii) contribute to or facilitate any illegal activity.  You represent and warrant that you will comply with all Applicable Laws, and you will not use the Site, any other Interface, or the Features if the laws of your country, or any Applicable Law, prohibit you from doing so.  ​​</p>
<p>Financial Risks.  Use of the Features, in particular entering into Prediction Markets on the Platform, may carry financial risk. You acknowledge and understand that Prediction Markets are inherently risky by their nature and participation in Prediction Markets could result in the loss of the full amount supplied, and you are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and assessment of risks before participating in any prediction market or placing any wager.  Prediction Markets such as the Prediction Markets available on the Platform are highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Prediction Markets are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site, any other Interface, and the Features, including the Prediction Markets and the Platform, at your own risk. The risk of loss in transacting in cryptoassets using Prediction Markets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such transactions are suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. Further, such risks and adverse outcomes may be exacerbated when leverage and/or derivative products are used and we may, at any time and in our sole discretion, elect to suspend or terminate our support of any or all supported Prediction Markets.  BY USING THE PLATFORM TO TRADE AND ENTER INTO CONTRACTS, YOU CAN LOSE UP TO THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE CRYPTOASSETS SUPPLIED TO THE PREDICTION MARKETS.</p>
<p>Prediction Markets Resolution.  You acknowledge and understand that the Company is not involved in nor responsible for the resolution of any Prediction Markets displayed on the Platform.  You acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible for any disputes related to the resolution of any Prediction Markets.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver</h2>
  <h3 class="subhead">Governing Law</h3>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Panama, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes that you and the Company are not required to arbitrate will be the courts located in Panama, and you and the Company each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any Claim by engaging in good faith negotiations.  Such negotiations require that the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the dispute (the “Initial Notice”).  The party receiving such notice shall have twenty days to respond, and within forty-five days after the Initial Notice was sent, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to try and resolve the Claim.  If the parties are unable to do so within ninety days of the Initial Notice, the parties may agree to mediate their dispute or either party may submit to arbitration according to these Terms.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Mandatory Arbitration</h3>
<p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Terms, Interfaces or Features, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be determined by arbitration in Panama before one arbitrator. This clause will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<div class="callout"><p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, THE PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.</p></div>
<h3 class="subhead">Class Action / Representative Claim Waiver</h3>
<p>Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy will be brought and conducted only in your individual capacity and not as a party (plaintiff or otherwise) or member of any class (or purported class), consolidated proceeding, multi-plaintiff proceeding or representative action or proceeding. Any arbitration will not be permitted to be consolidated or aggregated with any other arbitration and the arbitrator will not have any authority to do so and will not have the authority to make an award to any person or entity not a part of the individual arbitration in which you are a party.  You further agree that any arbitrator may not preside over any form of class action involving you and us.</p>

  <h2>12. General Terms</h2>
  <h3 class="subhead">Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>The Terms, including any policies that expressly incorporate the Terms by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter herein. The Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, agreements, or communications between you and us, if any, whether written or verbal, regarding the subject matter of the Terms.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">No Relationships or Assignments</h3>
<p>Nothing in the Terms shall be construed to create any relationship between you and us other than as defined herein.  Neither you nor we are an agent of each other under these Terms or otherwise, and you shall have no right to hold yourself out as in any way having a relationship with us other than as someone using, accessing or otherwise interfacing with the Interface and/or Features.</p>
<p>You agree that you are not permitted to assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights and obligations under the Terms, but the Company may assign or transfer the Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be void.  Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Waiver</h3>
<p>The failure by us to enforce any provision of the Terms will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit our right to enforce such provision at a later time.  All waivers by us must be in writing to be effective.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Severability</h3>
<p>If any portion of the Terms are held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from the Terms but the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Remedies</h3>
<p>Any right or remedy of the Company set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law, or in equity. The failure or delay of the Company in exercising or enforcing any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.</p>
