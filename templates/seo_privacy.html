You authorize our third-party payment vendors and wallet providers to collect, process, and store your financial information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. For the purposes of this Policy, an “account connection” with such a third party is a connection you authorize or enable between your account and a payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.

Examples of account connections include, without limitation: linking your account to a social media account or social messaging Services; connecting your account to a third-party data aggregation or financial Services company, if you provide such company with your account log-in credentials; or using your account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your account. If you connect your account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party Services provider, we may have access to your account balance and account and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third party about you and your use of the third-party’s Services. For example, if you connect your account to a social media account, we will receive personal information from the social media provider via the account connection. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Policy.</li>
<li>Other information: any additional data you provide to us, which we will use as described in this Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.</li>
</ul>

<li>Local storage technologies: Technologies like HTML5 provide functionality similar to cookies but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser, in connection with specific applications.</li>
<li>Web beacons: Also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, these are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data about others. We may provide features that allow users to invite others to use the Services.
